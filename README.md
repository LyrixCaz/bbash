# bbash
Basic Bash Scripting Command &amp; Concepts.
In here you will find scripts or rather "workers" due to me pulling them from my workstation. Alot of these scripts can be used in a crontab for system automation routines.
#Be advised! 
These workers are made to be independent of any third party program; you can basically run these in any linux computer.
