# bbash
Basic Bash Scripting Command &amp; Concepts.
In here you will find scripts "LV0 workers & Janitors, etc." due to me pulling them from my workstation. Alot of these scripts can be used in a crontab for system automation routines.

Be advised, these workers are made to be as independent as possible of any number of programs; you can basically run these in any linux computer without requiring your password, for the most part.
